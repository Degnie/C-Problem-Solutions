# 🖥️ C Problem Solutions

This repository contains a collection of exercises and problem solutions written in C.
Its purpose is to help learners strengthen their understanding of programming by solving progressively challenging tasks — starting from fundamental concepts such as variables, conditionals, and loops, and moving toward intermediate and advanced topics like modular programming, data structures, and algorithmic problem-solving.
The idea is not only to practice syntax, but also to develop logical thinking, problem-solving strategies, and clean coding habits that can be applied in real-world programming.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **basic-exercises/** → General introductory exercises in C (variables, operators, input/output, etc.).  
- **iterative-pre-condition/** → Exercises with pre-condition loops (`while`, `for`), including patterns, tables, and figures.  
- *(More folders will be added as we advance: functions, arrays, pointers, data structures, etc.)*
